# Defaults for puppetmaster - sourced by /etc/init.d/puppetmaster

# Start puppetmaster on boot? If you are using passenger, you should
# have this set to "no"
START=no

# Startup options
DAEMON_OPTS=""

# What server type to run
# Options:
#          webrick: default, cannot handle more than ~30 nodes
#          mongrel: scales better than webrick because you can run
#                   multiple processes if you are getting
#                   connection-reset or End-of-file errors, switch to
#                   mongrel. Requires front-end web-proxy such as
#                   apache, nginx, or pound, more information:
#                   http://puppetlabs.com/trac/puppet/wiki/UsingMongrel
#          passenger: no need to set this, be sure to set START=no above
SERVERTYPE=webrick

# How many puppetmaster instances to start? Its pointless to set this
# higher than 1 if you are not using mongrel.
PUPPETMASTERS=1

# What port should the puppetmaster listen on (default: 8140). If
# PUPPETMASTERS is set to a number greater than 1, then the port for
# the first puppetmaster will be set to the port listed below, and
# further instances will be incremented by one
#
# NOTE: if you are using mongrel, then you will need to have a
# front-end web-proxy (such as apache, nginx, pound) that takes
# incoming requests on the port your clients are connecting to
# (default is: 8140), and then passes them off to the mongrel
# processes.  In this case it is recommended to run your web-proxy on
# port 8140 and change the below number to something else, such as
# 18140.
PORT=8140
