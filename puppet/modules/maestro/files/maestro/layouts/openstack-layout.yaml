# Openstack layout - Version 0.01
#

# This file has been created to be focused for the first generator script to manage openstack as a Blueprint implementation.
#
# On Maestro, this file will need to be located under /usr/lib/maestro/layouts.
# By convention, the layout will be named as <bluePrintName>-layout.yaml to make the distinction against the master one.

# Variables:
# There is at least 3 kind of variables. All of these variables are defined from the blueprint. 
# In the deploy file, we will implement 2 kind of files:
# - hiera variables. We will have a file per servers.
#   blueprints/openstack/puppet/modules/runtime_project/files/hiera/hieradata/Debian/nodetype/*.yaml
# - site.pp
#   site.pp will need to be replaced by a collection of files. See http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/dirs_manifest.html
#   Currently, I have updated site.pp to reflect a simplified util section. But this should be stored under a <server>.pp

blueprint-deploy:
   blueprint : openstack-1.0 # This refer to another file which describes the blueprint itself. 
                             # In this case, I named this file blueprint/openstack-1.0.yaml.
                             # Most of default modules variables are kept in the blueprint file, like vhost_name for 'graphite' or even 'status'.
   servers:
     - util: # This define the server which will have a list of application installed.
       name: util
       applications:
        - graphite: # Any class references are stored on the blueprint file. We are listing only top elements and data required set up during layout.
          hiera:
            class_params: # Those options has been fixed during the setup of the layout. Default values not updated are kept referenced from the blueprint.
