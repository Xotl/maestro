# Wrapper calls to mysql::server::config class
#
# What it does?
# (1) Creates a .cnf file at /etc/mysql/conf.d/
# (2) The values of step 1 overrides the values at /etc/mysql/my.cnf settings
# (3) Restarts mysql
#
# Parameters:
# key_buffer_size:      The value of key_buffer_size is the size of the buffer used with indexes.
#                       The larger the buffer, the faster the SQL command will finish and a result will be returned.
# table_open_cache:     Number of open tables for all threads.
# max_allowed_packet:   The maximum size of one packet or any generated/intermediate string.
# thread_stack:         The stack size for each thread.
# query_cache_limit:    Caches results until this limit.
# sort_buffer_size:     Each session that needs to do a sort allocates a buffer of this size.
# read_buffer_size:     Each thread that does a sequential scan for a MyISAM table allocates a buffer of this size for each table it scans.
# read_rnd_buffer_size: When reading rows from a MyISAM table in sorted order following a key-sorting operation,
#                       the rows are read through this buffer to avoid disk seeks.
# net_buffer_length:    Each client thread is associated with a connection buffer and result buffer.
#                       Both begin with a size given by net_buffer_length but are dynamically enlarged up to max_allowed_packet bytes as needed.
# join_buffer_size:     The minimum size of the buffer that is used for plain index scans, range index scans,
#                       and joins that do not use indexes and thus perform full table scans.
