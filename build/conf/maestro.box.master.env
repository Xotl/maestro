# Please READ carefully the `build/README.md' on how bootstrapping is built to update this file accordingly.
#
#
# This file is loaded by default by the branch detected on your system. But you can force it with --gitbranch
#

# Build Configuration FileName convention
# =======================================
#
# This build configuration file name is built from 3 variables set by build.sh
# {APP_PATH}.{BUILD_CONFIG}.{GITBRANCH].env
#
# GITBRANCH is 'master' by default. or Current GIT branch if option --gitBranchCur, or any valid branch set by --gitBranch <BranchName>
# APP_PATH is set from --box-name <BoxName>
# BUILD_CONFIG is set from --build-config

# When you start your build, the server name will be set by BUILD_ID.
# This variable can be set by --build_ID option.
# If you want to ignore --build_ID, you canf for it by uncomment the following line and set your desired BUILD_ID
# BUILD_ID=MyBuild
PREFIX=maestro.
SUFFIX=.forj.io
if [ "${BUILD_ID}" = "" ]
then
   BUILD_ID=bld
fi
BUILD_ID=$PREFIX$BUILD_ID

#
# If you want to introduce prefix or suffix to --build_ID, uncomment the following and set Prefix and/or Suffix as you need.
# BUILD_ID=Prefix${BUILD_ID}Suffix
# this file will need to be named as ${APP_PATH}.${BUILD_CONFIG}.env (located by --build-config-dir)

# HPCloud Account naming
# ======================
#
# You need to create the 'FORJ_HPC' in your HPCloud setup with hpcloud account:setup <FORJ_HPC>.
# to simplify, we used 'dev' as HPCloud account to use.
# If you already have an HPCloud account set, you can change it there.
# Otherwise, build.sh, will create that one, based on the 'hp' account.

FORJ_HPC=dev

# If you want to have a generic way to define your HPCloud account configuration based on this configuration file,
# you can set it like:
# FORJ_HPC=${APP_PATH}.${BUILD_CONFIG}.dev

# Ensure HPCloud account settings
# ===============================

# To ensure that some definition for your build configuration, update any of the following as needed. (FORJ_HPC_*)
# Uncomment any of those FORJ_HPC_* to force there usage with this build configuration:
