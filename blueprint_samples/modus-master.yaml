# Modus blueprint - Version 0.01

# It describes what development tools, flows and services are implemented to start developing like Openstack do development and Continuous integration.

# This is a prototype version

# All blueprint files will be located in /usr/lib/maestro/blueprints
# This file will need to be installed as modus-master.yaml under 'blueprints' directory.
# By convention, we will name it <BluePrintName>-master.yaml to make distinction with the layout.
# Each repository will create a <repo>/blueprint/ which will contains different blueprint this repository can offer.
# Blueprints convention is to have <repo>/blueprint/<Blueprint>-master.yaml
# A default layout can be automatically loaded by maestro, for trial versions, stored as:
# <repo>/blueprint/default_layout/<Blueprint>-layout.yaml
